GENERAL NOTES:
- should have main.py that runs everything, at root of repo
- /src folder should be for all Python modules made
- have to use Pipenv, Lucid isn't available via Conda


TODOs:
- add any big data junk to .gitignore that we don't want to store in Git
- deal with Svelte setup (need to install via Node, it's a compiler of sorts)
- add naive method back to activation_grids..., big method takes too long to debug
- decide on visualization strategy
