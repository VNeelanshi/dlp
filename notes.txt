GENERAL NOTES:
- should have main.py that runs everything, at root of repo
- /src folder should be for all Python modules made
- need to decide as team on package manager (pipenv vs conda)
    - IMPORTANT: Python version must be 3.7 in order to work with Tensorflow 2
    - using Pipenv for now
    - Svelte setup: https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started


TODOs:
- add any big data junk to .gitignore that we don't want to store in Git
- deal with Svelte setup (need to install via Node, it's a compiler of sorts)
